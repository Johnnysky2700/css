      <p>It is important that you understand that there is a
        difference between a good person and someone that
        has the Spirit of God. They are two different things,
        completely different,you will say he is nice, he is a
        moralist; those things are generally good, but there is
        still a great difference between knowing God and
        being good, because on one side, the person is trying
        to live right based on his own strength: but the other
        person that has Christ is no more living his life based
        on his own strength, he is living by the Spirit of God.
        There is a difference.
