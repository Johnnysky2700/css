        <p> They are two different things,
            completely different,you will say he is nice, he is a
            moralist; those things are generally good, but there is
            still a great difference between knowing God and
            being good, because on one side, the person is trying
            to live right based on his own strength: but the other
            person that has Christ is no more living his life based
            on his own strength, he is living by the Spirit of God.
            There is a difference.</p>
